				<h2>Testimonial</h2>

				<div class="section_w250 float_l">
					<h3>By: Anand Kumar</h3>
					<p>The staff are friendly and try and help as much as they can.

						The Harry Potter exhibition is spectacular! So much to read but it
						is fascinating! Especially reading the annotated drafts!.</p>

					<h3>By: Shekhar Raut</h3>
					<p>An excellent place for any sort of research or just to visit
						for exhibitions and displays. If you want to use the reading rooms
						you will need to get a readers ticket, so take ID if you think
						you'll want to see any books or other original materials. Some
						items are stored off site so always check before you go. Staff are
						friendly and helpful and the building is fantastic.</p>
